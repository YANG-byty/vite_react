classNames  样式类合并器
import classNames from 'classnames' //样式类合并器
用于样式动态添加
例：<ul className={classNames({ 'ul': true })}>666</ul>

react-router-dom6.3.0  路由
必须要用函数返回,并且根目录下的index.js中，<App>的最外侧包襄了一个<BrowserRouter>或<HashRouter></HashRouter>才能正常的使用路由跳转
const Views = () => useRoutes(indexRouter)
例：<Views />

react-redux  状态管理
下面来对接react-redux与store，让全部组件都能方便引用store。
例：<Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>

immutable 状态管理中不可改变的
由于state是引用型，不能直接修改，否则是监测不到state发生变化的。因此需要先复制一份进行修改，然后再返回新的state。
解决方法是使用fromJS方法把原始的JS类型转化为immutable（不可变）类型。

监听props变化
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
  if (props.data != state.data) {
    return {
      progressBar: props.progressBar,
      color: props.color,
      data: props.data,
      model: state.progressBarChart(props),
    }
  }
  return null
}

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
